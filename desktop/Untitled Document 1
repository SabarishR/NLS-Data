example
--------
1) Let's say Customer average spend per day 1000 and average transaction per day is 5
but for the same customer the average spend goes 100000 and avg transaction goes 50 then We would say this might be chance of fraudulent 

2) The past transaction happened with the avg duration of 10 seconds and now the last transaction happening with 40 seconds there might be chance of fraudulent.
may be system slowness. but we would say as per past status. if the status goes approved then wont be issue. but most of the same cases if it is declined then chance of fraudulent 

3) In ATM,the last two transaction were failed due to incorrect pin. and further next transaction happend in a same medium. The customer reports the respective transaction is fraud then against the same scienaio multiple fraud reports then there is a fraudulant case

4) The transaction frequency is rare, few tym in a month and with a few minitues multiple transaction happening then there is chance of fradulant

5) Several small transactions are made in a short time using the same or similar card numbers

6) The shipping address does not match billing address, especially if the shipping address is a freight forwarder or re-shipper

7) The customer tries different expiration dates after initial decline
