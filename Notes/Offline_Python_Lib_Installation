### Move to the environment you're supposed to backup, Then

mkdir dependencies
pip download -r requirements.txt -d "./dependencies"
tar cvfz dependencies.tar.gz dependencies


And, once you transfer the dependencies.tar.gz to the machine which does not have internet you would do:

tar zxvf dependencies.tar.gz
cd dependencies
pip install * -f ./ --no-index
